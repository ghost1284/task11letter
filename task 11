      <h2><b>Re: Eileen Dover University application</b></h2>
      <br>
      Dear Eilen,
      Thank you for your recent appplication to join us at the University of Awesome's
  faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your question one
  by one, in the following sections.
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time ,
  however it would suit us better if you could start at beginning of a semester,
  the start dates for each one are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>First Semester: 9 september 2016</li>
    <li>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester : 2 May 2017</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
  <br />
  You can find more information about <a href="importantuniversitydates.html">important university dates</a> on our website.
  <h2>Subjects of Study</h2> 
  At the awesome Science Faculty , We have a pretty open-minded research faculty -as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of Science
  and technology . You seem like an intelligent , dedicated reseacher , and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying
  that, of the ideas you submitted we were not intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
  <ol>
      <li>Turning H <sub>2</sub>O into wine , and the health benefits of Resveratrol ( C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
      <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30 <sup>0</sup>C (85<sup>0</sup>F), When
      the audience size exponetially increases (effect of 3 X 10<sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 X 10 <sup>4</sup>.)</li> 
      <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
  </ol>
      <p> So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except the research to take , requried staff
  and other rescources, and anything else you think we'd need to know ? Thanks.</p>
  <h2>Exotic dance Moves</h2>
  Yes, you are right! As part of my post - doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question , my facourite
  dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>

  <dl>
    <dt>Polynesian Chicken danced
        <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
            around in a circle like Chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful" </dd>
    </dt>
<dt>Icelandic brownian shuf</dt>
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm , they used to practic this dance, which involved huddling close 
    together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impereceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. one of my fellow 
    students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered 
        a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, beind practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.
    Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold. </dd>
